# Switcher for Umbraco 7

Switcher is a simple property editor that works as an alternative to the core true/false datatype.
It can be used for different kinds of true/false values e.g. on/off, active/deactive or enabled/disabled and gives a more visual feedback to the content editor. Furthermore it is great for content editors, who edit content from tablets, where the switch-button is touch friendly.
